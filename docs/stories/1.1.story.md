# Story 1.1: Deploy Core AWS Infrastructure & Frontend Web App

## Status: Approved

## Story

- As a **project creator**
- I want to **deploy the core static web application and foundational AWS infrastructure**
- so that **the basic web interface is accessible, and the environment for backend development is ready**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. An **AWS S3 bucket** for frontend static assets is provisioned.
2. An **Amazon CloudFront distribution** is configured to serve content from the S3 bucket via HTTPS, with caching enabled.
3. The **Vite-based React frontend application** is successfully deployed to S3/CloudFront and is publicly accessible via a CloudFront URL.
4. The web application displays the **first frame of the provided MP4 video** as the static wheel image.
5. An **AWS API Gateway** instance is provisioned, ready to receive HTTP requests.
6. An **initial AWS Lambda function** (e.g., a simple "hello world" or health check endpoint) is deployed and accessible via API Gateway to confirm basic backend connectivity.
7. **AWS IAM roles** with least-privilege permissions are created for Lambda execution and S3/CloudFront deployment.
8. A **basic CI/CD pipeline** (e.g., GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline/CodeBuild) is set up to automatically deploy frontend changes to S3/CloudFront upon code commits to the main branch.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story exists - this is the first story.

### Data Models
No data models required for this story - infrastructure and frontend setup only.

### API Specifications
Initial health check endpoint for Lambda:
- GET /health
  - Response: 200 OK
  - Body: `{ "status": "healthy", "timestamp": "ISO-8601 timestamp" }`
  - No authentication required for MVP
[Source: architecture.md#192-203]

### Component Specifications
Frontend should use React 18.x with TypeScript 5.x and Tailwind CSS 3.x for styling. The main component should display the MP4 video's first frame as a static image.
[Source: architecture.md#114-138]

### File Locations
Based on the unified project structure:
- Frontend code: `/apps/web/`
- Frontend static assets (MP4): `/apps/web/public/`
- CI/CD workflows: `/.github/workflows/`
- Infrastructure as Code: Consider using Serverless Framework or AWS CDK in `/packages/deployment/`
[Source: architecture.md#383-446]

### Testing Requirements
For this infrastructure story, focus on manual verification of deployments. Automated tests will be added in subsequent stories.
[Source: architecture.md#690-741]

### Technical Constraints
- Node.js LTS version (20.x recommended)
- AWS deployment region: us-east-1 recommended
- Use pnpm for monorepo management
- Serverless-first approach for backend components
- S3 bucket naming: Use kebab-case with environment suffix (e.g., `wheel-of-stuff-frontend-prod`)
- CloudFormation/CDK stack naming: PascalCase with environment (e.g., `WheelOfStuffBackendProd`)
[Source: architecture.md#100-138, architecture.md#456-461, architecture.md#843-844]

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Manual verification tests only for this infrastructure story

Manual Test Steps:
- Navigate to the CloudFront URL and verify the application loads
- Verify HTTPS is working correctly
- Check that the MP4 first frame displays as the wheel image
- Test the health check endpoint via API Gateway URL
- Verify CI/CD pipeline triggers on commit to main branch

### Debug Log References

[[LLM: (Dev Agent) If the debug is logged to during the current story progress, create a table with the debug log and the specific task section in the debug log - do not repeat all the details in the story]]

### Completion Notes List

- Used Tailwind CSS v4 which required @tailwindcss/postcss plugin instead of direct tailwindcss in PostCSS config
- MP4 video file needs to be manually added to /apps/web/public/wheel.mp4 before deployment
- AWS credentials must be configured in GitHub Secrets before CI/CD pipeline can run
